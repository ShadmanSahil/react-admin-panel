## About

This project was built as part of my learning journey in frontend development with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The goal was to practice building a modern, responsive web application from scratch while applying key concepts such as component-based architecture, state management with hooks, and client-side routing.

I also explored <strong>Chakra UI</strong> for theming and styling, and <strong>Recharts.js</strong> for data visualization. While the core functionality is complete, the codebase is currently being refactored and cleaned up for improved readability and maintainability.
